To run configure, specify the machine type and the version of 
the code to make.

Examples:
./configure -cpu=dec mflops
./configure -cpu=sun dmflops

Possible machine types (Unix versions) include: 
cray, dec, ibm, hp, linux, sgi, solaris, sun
(sun is SUNOS, the predecessor to Solaris)

Possible code versions are: 
mflops,dmflops,cmflops,dcmflops

mflops uses single precision numbers and Fortran kernels.
dmflops uses double precision numbers and Fortran kernels (default).
cmflops uses single precision numbers and C kernels.
dcmflops uses double precision numbers and C kernels.

The Makefile does not have full support for the C kernels. 
cloops (a pure C progam) is the easiest way to measure performance in C.
